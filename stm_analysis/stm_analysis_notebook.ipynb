    "This is a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that summarises and analyses any data obtained from STM experiments performed at the [London Centre for Nanotechnology (LCN)](https://www.london-nano.com/). The raw data can take the form of a topography scan (*.Z_flat* file), a spectroscopy scan (*.I(V)_flat* file) and a current-distance scan (*I(Z)_flat* file) - all of which are displayed and analysed within this Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",

    "- The initial raw MATRIX files must be converted to flat-files by using the [Vernissage](http://www.scientaomicron.com/en/software-downloads-matrix-spm-control/55) software, available by Scienta Omicron, for them to be viewed and/or analysed by this Jupyter notebook. More importantly, this will then allow you to use Vernissage as a data reduction tool, such that all the *good* and *sensible* data can be imported into this Jupyter notebook for viewing and subsequent analysis.\n",
    "- The path to the parent directory, that holds all the data directories, each of which contain all the flat-files, must be defined by the *dataPath* variable and the path to the directory that contains the stm-analysis module must be defined by the *modulePath* variable.\n",
