    "This is a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that summarises and analyses any data obtained from STM experiments performed at the [London Centre for Nanotechnology (LCN)](https://www.london-nano.com/). The raw data can take the form of a topography scan (*.Z_flat* file), a spectroscopy scan (*.I(V)_flat* file) and a current-distance scan (*I(Z)_flat* file) - all of which are displayed and analysed within this Jupyter notebook.\n",

More importantly, this will then allow you to use Vernissage as a data reduction tool, such that all the *good* and *sensible* data can be imported into this Jupyter notebook for viewing and subsequent analysis.\n",

If '*Both*' traces are selected, then the average is taken over all the *traces* and *retraces*, however, the '*Traces*' option is there to allow the data analysis to be executed over just the '*Trace*' or '*Retrace*' I(V) curves.\n",
    "- **Smoothing**: Binomial provides smoothing to data points and the smoothing order here controls the window size over which the Binomial smoothing has been performed. Savitzky-Golay smoothing is the default smoothing method as it is found that this provides a much better smoothing in regards to the raw data vs smoothed data. For this method, it has a window length of 51 and the order of the running polynomial is determined by the smoothing order.\n",
    "- **Differentiating**: The dI/dV curve is vertically offset by 1.1 times its minimum value to ensure that there are no data points that are negative.\n",

If you find that the dI/dV curve has a minimjum, but at the edges it has values that are decreasing much more due to noise in the I(V) curve, it is reccomended to use the *Restrict V* slider to cut the domain of the I(V) curves such that it has a typical shape and doesn't screw the band-gap calcualtor.\n",
